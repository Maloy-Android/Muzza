## Development Workflow

1. **Read AGENT.md** - Understand the autonomous development protocol
2. **Review requirements.md** - Understand what needs to be built
3. **Study design.md** - Understand how it should be architected
4. **Follow tasks.md** - Implement features in the specified order

## Key Features Being Implemented

- **Material 3 Expressive Design System** with motion physics
- **Dynamic Color Extraction** from album artwork
- **Physics-Based Animations** and micro-interactions
- **AI-Powered Theming Intelligence** with genre adaptation
- **Advanced Visual Effects** including particle systems
- **Immersive Music Visualization Studio** with real-time audio analysis
- **Premium Micro-Interactions** with haptic choreography
- **Intelligent Layout System** with content-aware adaptation

## For AI Agents

This documentation is specifically designed for autonomous AI development. The AGENT.md file contains:
- **Mandatory web search protocols** to stay current
- **Research-driven development workflows**
- **Autonomous work-until-completion guidelines**
- **Comprehensive coding standards and patterns**

AI agents should use web search tools extensively to research latest developments, find inspiration, and reduce hallucinations before implementing any features.
