/**
 * Pure (no Android deps) policy for recovering from WebView renderer deaths.
 *
 * A killed renderer under sustained memory pressure will typically be killed again while
 * re-parsing the ~2.8 MB player.js, so after [maxConsecutiveFailures] consecutive failures the
 * policy opens a backoff window during which [shouldAttempt] is false and callers skip the
 * doomed multi-second rebuild for that song.
 *
 * The window is deliberately SHORT and half-open: the non-WebView paths (NewPipe extractor,
 * fallback clients) are unreliable — the cipher WebView is the primary path — so we must get
 * back to retrying it quickly once memory pressure may have eased. Once the window expires, one
 * attempt is allowed. Success fully resets the policy; another failure re-arms the window
 * immediately.
 *
 * Callers pass a monotonic clock value (e.g. SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()) so the policy stays
 * JVM-testable.
